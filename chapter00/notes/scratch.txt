Project Sample: Criminal Evidence Management System
    - VIEWER: The user can query the evidence database to retrieve information.
    - DETECTIVE: The user can submit evidence, retrieve it for analysis, or return it to the evidence locker.
    - ADMIN: An account with special privileges that can manage other users' activities on the evidence system.
Evidence has to be linked to a case.
A case usually has multiple evidence items linked to it.
Every time a piece of evidence is submitted, retrieved for analysis or returned, a track entry is created that contains
    the detective accessing the evidence and the reason for them to do so.
A detective can be a lead on a case investigation, but can also be an investigator for another case.
A detective can work on multiple cases at once.
A detective can have different ranks:
    - TRAINEE: No access to the evidence system
    - JUNIOR: Read access to the evidence system
    - SENIOR: Write access to the evidence system
    - INSPECTOR: Write access to the evidence system and read access to the personnel system
    - CHIEF_INSPECTOR: Write access to the evidence system and personnel system
Cases can be classified based on their severity as follows:
    - INFRACTION: The smallest of crimes (community service and/or a fine)
    - MISDEMEANOR: A crime punishable with incarceration for one year or less
    - FELONY: The most serious crimes
Cases can be classified by the investigation status as follows:
    - SUBMITTED: Recently introduced into the system
    - UNDER_INVESTIGATION: The evidence is being collected; investigation in process
    - IN_COURT: All evidence is submitted, conclusions have been drawn, people have been arrested, and now the lawyers
        their thing in court.
    - CLOSED: All evidence is archived, the case has been solved; people have been sentenced.
    - DISMISSED: An invalid case that required no investigation.
    - COLD: A case that was in UNDER_INVESTIGATION state for more than 10 years
When a case is closed, all evidence is archived
Evidence is stored in different storage locations
The IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate edition can generate a diagram with the relationship between the classes, but also JPA
    specific relations between entity classes.
